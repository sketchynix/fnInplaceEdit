CONTRIBUTING
============

* Either open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/sketchynix/fnInplaceEdit/pull/new/master) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/sketchynix/fnInplaceEdit/issues/new) to discuss any changes you'd like to make
* Make sure your PR is on a **new branch** you created off of the latest version of master
* Do **not** open a PR from your master branch
* Open a PR to start a discussion even if the code isn't finished (easier to collect feedback this way)
* Make sure all previous tests pass and add new tests for added behaviors
